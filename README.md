Project Progress Report: Marvel Rivals Analytics

Date: Sunday, July 20, 2025

Project Goal: Develop a data analytics project for Marvel Rivals using the official Marvel API via a local Node.js proxy server.

I. Overall Status

The foundational setup for both the Python analytics project and the dependent Node.js Marvel API proxy server has been largely completed. The Git repository is correctly configured and synced with GitHub. The primary remaining blocker is to successfully get the Node.js proxy server running and accessible.

II. Progress Made (Key Achievements)

Main Project Setup (MarvelRivalsAnalytics):

The MarvelRivalsAnalytics local repository has been successfully initialized and linked to its GitHub remote (https://github.com/vasquezd21/MarvelRivalsAnalytics.git).

Initial project structure (e.g., python_scripts/, data/, notebooks/ - conceptually) established.

An initial README.md has been created and successfully pushed to GitHub, documenting the project's purpose and setup steps.

Complex Git divergence issue successfully resolved, allowing local commits to be pushed to a remote repository with a different initial history (git pull --allow-unrelated-histories --no-rebase followed by git push -u origin main).

Node.js Marvel API Proxy Server Setup (marvel-rivals-mcp-game-data):

The aimaginationlab/marvel-rivals-mcp repository has been successfully cloned into the marvel-rivals-mcp-game-data subdirectory.

All Node.js dependencies have been installed (npm install).

The server's TypeScript code has been successfully built into JavaScript (npm run build), generating the executable dist/src/index.js file.

.env file created and correctly configured: After extensive troubleshooting, the .env file (containing MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY and MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY) is now confirmed to be:

Correctly named .env.

Located in the marvel-rivals-mcp-game-data directory.

Properly formatted (no quotation marks, no leading/trailing spaces, no extraneous characters like %).

Confirmed to be read correctly by Node.js (verified using a test-env.js script that printed the loaded keys).

Port Check: Verified that port 3000 (the server's default port) is not in use by any other process (sudo lsof -i :3000 showed no output).

III. Current Blocker / Immediate Next Focus

Node.js Server Not Running/Accessible: Despite all setup steps and .env validation, the server, when launched with node dist/src/index.js, returns silently to the prompt and is not accessible via http://localhost:3000/ (browser shows "site can't be reached"). This indicates an immediate, unhandled crash during server startup.

IV. Progress Needed (Next Steps for LLM)

The priority is to get the Node.js proxy server running.

Re-verify Marvel API Keys (Highest Priority):

Action: User must meticulously verify their Public Key and Private Key directly from the Marvel Developer Portal (https://developer.marvel.com/account). Even if the .env file format is correct, the keys themselves might be invalid, revoked, or mistyped, leading to a silent client initialization failure. This is the strongest current hypothesis.

Expected Outcome: If keys are confirmed correct, move to the next step. If discrepancies are found, update .env and retry server start.

Add Early-Stage Debugging Logs to Server Source Code:

Context: If API keys are 100% confirmed valid and the server still exits silently, the crash is happening very early in its execution, before any default logging kicks in.

Action:

Navigate to /Users/dmv62/Projects/MarvelRivalsAnalytics/marvel-rivals-mcp-game-data/src/index.ts.

Add console.log('Server initialization phase 1...'); as the very first line of the file.

Add more console.log statements strategically in the initial setup/import sections (e.g., after dotenv.config(), before Marvel API client instantiation) to pinpoint the exact line or module causing the crash.

Save changes.

Rebuild the server: cd marvel-rivals-mcp-game-data && npm run build.

Relaunch the server: node dist/src/index.js.

Expected Outcome: Identify console output indicating where the server execution stops, revealing the source of the silent crash.

Investigate Marvel API Client Initialization (If logs pinpoint it):

Context: If logs show the crash occurring during the Marvel API client setup (e.g., after dotenv but before a successful API call), the issue is almost certainly with the keys or the client library's ability to connect to Marvel's servers (e.g., network issues, rate limits, firewall).

Action: Depending on the specific log output, investigate the Marvel API client's documentation for common initialization failures or add more specific try...catch blocks around the client instantiation to capture errors.

Python Project Development:

Action: Once the Node.js server is confirmed running, begin developing the Python scripts (python_scripts/data_extractor.py, etc.) to interact with http://localhost:3000/ and process the data.

Action: Create a requirements.txt file listing all necessary Python libraries for the project.

V. Noteworthy Context/Notes for LLM

User Environment: macOS, Zsh shell, Node.js v20.18.0.

Git Workflow: The user is now familiar with git add, git commit, git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories --no-rebase, and git push -u origin main.

.env Files: Critical that .env files are never committed to GitHub. The project's .gitignore should reflect this.

Server Entry Point: The compiled server runs via node dist/src/index.js.

Persistent Silent Exit: The server's immediate exit without console output is the primary challenge; this indicates an uncaught error.

Previous Troubleshooting: All standard .env formatting and port conflict checks have been exhausted. The next step must involve deeper application-level debugging or absolute key verification.
